		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		
		<p>In our modern society, technology plays an overwhelming role. Whether it be your cell phone, laptop or television, it is virtually impossible to leave your house for a full day without encountering technology in some form. These digital devices have helped our society grow and reach new heights no one imagined possible. However, people are often resistant to change and don’t always embrace the new electronics. Often when a new product is released, everyone talks about the negative side effects it could have on society. Technology is often in the news for being a distraction and acting as a barrier to our relationships. However, technology can also be used to help bring people together and feel more connected.   </p>

		<h2> Statement </h2>

		<p> Modern technology, such as FaceTime, social media and the news help to build and strengthen our personal relationships and outweigh the decrease of face to face interactions. </p>
	</div>

	<div id="Purpose" class="tabcontent">
		<h2>Statement of Purpose</h2>

		<p> The initial purpose of this composition is to write about how digital tools and technologies have affected me as a person, student or citizen. Beyond this, I want to share personal anecdotes and experiences to the readers about how technology, such as FaceTime, texting and social media have personally influenced my life and relationships. After reading this piece of writing, ideally, the audience should feel more connected to others through their personal technology. This paper will allow them to consider the viewpoint that technology can help build and strengthen their relationships rather than harm them. </p>

		<p> It is important that this idea gets communicates because many people are resistant to change. When a new product comes out, everyone talks about the negative side effects it could have on the community. Technology is often in the news for being a distraction and acting as a barrier to our relationships. I hope to get people to see that technology can be used to make others feel more connected rather than as a screen to hide behind. </p>

		<p> The best possible outcome would be for a reader to change their mind about how technology plays a role on their relationships. Although I don’t think every reader will completely reverse their ideas, hopefully this paper will begin the conversation and allow them to see the other side of the argument. It is important to see what both sides of the argument before declaring that technology builds relationships rather than tearing them down. </p>

		<p> Because I use technology so often at school, to stay in contact with friends and family from home, I know first hand how we can use digital media to strengthen our relationships. I have also seen personally how relationships can be ruined because of the abuse of technology. By conveying the message that technology can be beneficial to us, maybe some of the audience will see that, when used correctly, technology helps us grow together. </p>

		<p> The expected primary audience is my peers and teacher. The audience of other Purdue students gives me a chance to introduce myself to the class, as well as the university. These are the people who will be reading my paper and will likely all have a personal opinion about the subject. The secondary audience is the community as a whole, specifically the Purdue community. Most students at Purdue use some form of technology in their daily lives to communicate with others. This paper would give them ideas about how they too can strengthen their relationships through technology. </p>

		<p> Something important to keep in mind is the background of my intended audience. I don’t know how much technology my peers have used before. It is unclear to me whether they grew up with phones and laptops as their main form of contact or if technology is a new thing to them. Some people mays see technology as a distraction because of something personal in their lives. It is possible that they have emotional experiences that has led them to believe either side of my argument. Because of this, I expect that my audience will understand from the beginning where I am coming from, but also understand the opposing viewpoint. It is hard to completely grasp the entire audience for this piece for writing, so I must remember to focus on those who I know will be reading it. </p>

		<p> The main time of communication for my paper will be when a peer or teacher sits down to do their summer English work. Because this is a summer class, it is possible that they might not put much effort into reading and understanding the paper, because they want to be done with their work quickly. On the other hand, it is also possible, and more likely, that they will have more time to fully break down the ideas from the text because most people aren’t sharing their course load with other classes during the summer. Both my teacher and my peers will look at this composition with a critical eye, to help strengthen my argument and to help me grow as a writer. </p>

		<p> The place and media of communication for this composition will be through technology and the internet. This piece of writing will be sent to them online, hopefully strengthening the argument that relationships are built through technology. Although I have never met the classmate doing my peer review, we have a connection through this online class. Without technology, none of this relationship would have been possible. </p>

		<p> In a broader context, this paper is being read during a time where technology is ever changing. We don’t know what will be released soon to help communication. For now, because technology is so new, people are always scrutinizing it. Often, especially with the younger generation, technology is viewed as a distraction. Many also see technology as a way for people to hid from their true selves; one argument to build on the opposing viewpoint that technology is breaking down personal relationships. I hope to incorporate the audience, purpose and context explained here into a piece of writing which persuades readers that technology benefits our society and relationships. </p>

		<h2>The Assignemnt</h2>

		<p> The initial purpose of this composition is to write about how digital tools and technologies have affected me as a person, student or citizen. </p>

		<h2>Beyond the Assignment</h2>

		<p> Beyond this, I want to share personal anecdotes and experiences to the readers about how technology, such as FaceTime, texting and social media have personally influenced my life and relationships. </p>
	</div>

	<div id="FaceTime" class="tabcontent">
		<h2>FaceTime</h2>

		<h3 id="left">The Argument</h3>

		<p id="leftWords"> Video chat, most prominently FaceTime, has revolutionized long distance, even international, communication for the better. FaceTime has allowed people who are not living nearby to have face to face interactions. Think back to a time before the landline phone existed. To tell someone that you had gotten engaged or had a baby, you had to write a handwritten letter and deliver it in snail mail. We quickly progressed beyond this in the late 1870’s when the telephone was invented, transforming how quickly we could communicate with others. In modern society, most people carry a personal cellular device, many equipt with a camera. This has allowed for video conferencing, a much quicker form of personal communication than snail mail. </p>

		<h3 id="left">The Experience</h3>

		<p id="leftWords">  For college students, apps such as FaceTime help them to stay connected to their family after moving away. As someone who moved across the country for college, FaceTime has allowed me and my family to ease the transition away from home. Not everyone gets the privilege of visiting their friends and family on weekends, or even holidays. FaceTime has opened up the ability to maintain the important face to face communication that is necessary for a stable relationship. </p>

		<h3 id="left">Conclusion</h3>

		<p id="leftWords"> People feel more connected when they are can see their significant other, even if it’s through a screen.  </p>

	</div>

	<div id="FB_IG" class="tabcontent">
		<h2>Social Media</h2>

		<h3 id="left">The Argument</h3>

		<p id="leftWords"> Beyond FaceTime, other social media platforms, such as Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook have helped to strengthen our relationships throughout the years. Similar to FaceTime, Snapchat’s use of photograph has brought people together with some type of face to face interaction. People can send photographs much faster than ever before through Snapchat to communicate with people near and far. Facebook and Instagram play another significant role in maintaining personal relationships; they help to keep contact with acquaintances. It is difficult to keep up with everyone’s busy lives, in fact it’s impossible to think that you could have time to sit down and have lunch with every one of your friends </p>

		<h3 id="left">The Experience</h3>

		<p id="leftWords"> Since I’ve moved across the country, social media has played an even more prominent role in my daily life. Snapchat stories, a place for people to put funny photos and videos about their life, has given me a chance to see what all my friends from home are doing, even when I can’t be there. Furthermore, Instagram has lets it’s users connect to hundreds of people and “follow” what they are doing. If a classmate, Sophie, goes to a new, trendy rooftop restaurant in New York City, I can see it first on her Instagram. Her posts fill me in on what’s happening in her life, such as her thoughts and feelings about the restaurant she went to. This not only helps me build my relationship with Sophie by knowing what she’s doing without having to text her on the daily basis. But it also connects us through places and experiences. Facebook post are a phenomenal place to post announcements or share other experiences, such as a trip or a birthday celebration. Here many people will share your joy, laughter and pain without too much effort. </p>

		<h3 id="left">Conclusion</h3>

		<p> Keeping up with people's lives when you too are busy is difficult, social media has given society a chance to maintain healthy relationship without talking to each other on a daily basis. </p>

	</div>

	<div id="News" class="tabcontent">
		<h2>Passing the News</h2>

		<h3 id="left">The Argument</h3>

		<p id="leftWords"> News since the beginning of time spread like wildfire. Most of our history began as oral history and was spread through word of mouth. It soon became a part of our daily lives. The quintessential American home, as depicted in many photographs and videos in the past included the whole family around the breakfast table, eating eggs and drinking orange juice. Usually the mother was helping to prepare the meal while the father read his newspaper. The newspaper was a physical paper that was delivered to the house in the morning, read, then thrown away. In our modern society, the newspaper industry is falling behind because most news has made it onto our phones and the internet. </p>

		<h3 id="left">The Experience</h3>

		<p id="leftWords"> Most people don’t get the newspaper delivered on the daily any more. News has become so much more instantaneous that waiting for tomorrow’s newspaper would be too late. In our modern age, how fast news spreads has brought people together. Because it is so easy to share a post online or send someone a link, people are talking about all the same stories at a much faster rate. Apps online have kept news articles at our fingertips to read and share. This has brought people together because if they read something interesting, they don’t have to cut out the article and hand deliver it; they simple send it off to a friend with their thoughts about it. </p> 

		<h3 id="left">Conclusion</h3>

		<p id="leftWords"> Thanks to digital technology, news is so easily accessible and brings people together because everyone is communicating about the same information at a much faster rate. </p>

	</div>

	<div id="Opposition" class="tabcontent">
		<h2>The Opposing Viewpoint</h2>

		<h3 id="left">The Argument</h3>

		<p id="leftWords"> People are very resistant to change. When a new product comes out, everyone talks about the negative side effects it could have on the community. Technology is seen as a distraction and acting as a barrier to our relationships. Rather than communicating face to face, people can use the screen of their digital device to hide behind. Many believe that the lack of physically being together limits a relationship, sometimes to a point where it becomes unhealthy. </p>

		<h3 id="left">The Experience</h3>

		<p id="leftWords"> However, this “hiding” behind screens can sometimes be good. A shy teenager might be able to text a guy she has a crush on, when she might lack the confidence to do it in person. This is building young relationships between the guy and the girl, when might not have otherwise been possible. Furthermore, technology can be seen as a distraction. A common scene in today’s society is two people having lunch together, both sitting on their phones and neither talking to each other. This may seem as though they are too absorbed in their technology to care about each other. Conversely, technology has helped to strengthen the conversations we are already having. While having brunch with a friend, you are discussing the amount of money Ryan Reynolds must be making from the Deadpool movies, both of which are doing great in the box office. Your friend, who hasn’t seen the movies doesn’t believe you. To help prove your point, you Google facts about the movies and their gross incomes.  </p>

		<h3 id="left">Conclusion</h3>

		<p id="leftWords"> Information has become so easily accessible, helping you to learn and grow together. Rather than be a distraction to our social interactions, digital media can help our conversations deepen, thus deepening our relationships.  </p>

	</div>

	<div id="Conclusion" class="tabcontent">
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>

		<p id="leftWords"> Personal technology has helped our society grow together and strengthens our relationships. Even when people are resistant to new technology, everything has a benefit to bringing us together. FaceTime and social media have allowed people to stay in contact, even when across the country. FaceTime has allowed for some face to face interactions while social media lets it’s users stay connected without daily communication. Our news, being at the click of a button, has allowed the community to laugh and cry together, at a much faster rate than ever before. Technology thus, can be beneficial to us and when used correctly it can help strengthen our relationships. </p>
